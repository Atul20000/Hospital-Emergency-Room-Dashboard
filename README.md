HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM DASHBOARD

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview :-

This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of hospital emergency room performance. It tracks patient count, average wait time, satisfaction score, admission status, and referral details. The dashboard offers consolidated, monthly and detailed patient views it helping hospital staff to monitor trends, identify peak hours, and improve service efficiency.

The dashboard presents three key views:

Monthly View â€“ A detailed month-by-month breakdown of key metrics to identify short-term trends and patterns.

Consolidated View â€“ A high-level summary of emergency room performance across the selected date range, including total patients, average wait time, patient satisfaction score, admission status and referral patterns.

Patient Details View â€“ A searchable and filterable table containing individual patient records, including demographics, wait times, referrals, and admission status.


ðŸ“Š Key Insights :-

No. of Patients â€“ Total number of patients visiting the emergency room.

Average Wait Time â€“ Average time patients wait before being seen.

Patient Satisfaction Score â€“ Feedback rating based on patient surveys.

No. of Patients Referred â€“ Patients referred to other departments for further care.

Patient Admission Status â€“ Admitted vs. non-admitted patient ratio.

% of Patients Seen Within 30 Minutes â€“ Measure of service responsiveness.

Patients by Age Group â€“ Distribution of patients across age categories.

Patients by Gender â€“ Male, Female, and Not Confirmed percentages.

Patients by Department Referral â€“ Breakdown of referrals to various specialties.

Patients by Race â€“ Demographic diversity analysis.

Patients by Day & Hour â€“ Heatmap and chart showing peak ER traffic times.
